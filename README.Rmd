This is my personal usethis-customization package.
While some of the functions might serve as inspiration for others, you should not try to use it directly for your own purposes.
For example, it's hard-coded to either create packages in the r4ds organization, or in my personal github.

## Installation

You can install the development version of andthis from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jonthegeek/andthis")
```

## Code of Conduct
